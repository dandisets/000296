description: 'Associated Reference Publication: Excitatory and inhibitory neural dynamics
  jointly tune motion detection

  Neurons integrate excitatory and inhibitory signals to produce their outputs, but
  the role of input timing in this integration remains poorly understood. Motion detection
  is a paradigmatic example of this integration, since theories of motion detection
  rely on different delays in visual signals. These delays allow circuits to compare
  scenes at different times to calculate the direction and speed of motion. Different
  motion detection circuits have different velocity sensitivity, but it remains untested
  how the response dynamics of individual cell types drive this tuning. Here, we sped
  up or slowed down specific neuron types in Drosophilaâ€™s motion detection circuit
  by manipulating ion channel expression. Altering the dynamics of individual neuron
  types upstream of motion detectors increased their sensitivity to fast or slow visual
  motion, exposing distinct roles for excitatory and inhibitory dynamics in tuning
  directional signals, including a role for the amacrine cell CT1. A circuit model
  constrained by functional data and anatomy qualitatively reproduced the observed
  tuning changes. Overall, these results reveal how excitatory and inhibitory dynamics
  together tune a canonical circuit computation.'
